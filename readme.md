I have made a quiz app using javascript.
I used local storage to store the name of user who is playing the quiz.
I have used array to store the questions and their options and correct answer.
I have added 6 questions for the quiz.
I used radio buttons for the options.
To print the result i used if conditions according to the percentage of user.
